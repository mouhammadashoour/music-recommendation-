# Music Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based recommendation system similar to Spotify's. It predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a song within a set timeframe.

## Objective
The goal is to create personalized song recommendations based on user listening histories and song timestamps.

## Methodology
The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation algorithms to generate suggestions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes user song histories with binary indicators for repeated plays within a month.

## Results
The recommendation model achieved an accuracy of X%, successfully identifying user preferences in a test set.

## Usage
To run this notebook:
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
- Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially.
